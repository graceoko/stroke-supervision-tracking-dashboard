# Stroke Supervision & Tracking Database

## Project Overview
This project was developed as an elective final project for HI 2451: Database Design & Big Data Analytics at the University of Pittsburgh. The goal was to design and implement a centralized stroke supervision and tracking system to support timely clinical decision-making, guideline compliance monitoring, and quality improvement initiatives in a hospital setting.

The system was modeled for a regional medical center specializing in neurology and rehabilitation and focuses on improving data consistency, real-time visibility, and cross-departmental coordination for stroke encounters.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server (SSMS) – centralized relational database
- Microsoft Access – data entry interface and query development
- Power BI – reporting and dashboard visualization
- Role-based access control, encryption at rest (TDE), and secure data transfer (SSL/TLS)

## System Design
The database supports:
- Longitudinal tracking of patients and stroke encounters
- Clinical snapshot data at the time of encounter (e.g., BMI, glucose)
- Treatment documentation
- Guideline compliance checks
- Data quality flagging for audit and reporting purposes

The system architecture integrates SQL Server as the backend, Microsoft Access as the front-end interface for clinical staff, and Power BI for executive and compliance dashboards.

## My Role & Contributions
- Contributed to database design and business rule definition
- Assisted with ERD development and schema refinement
- Supported query development for stroke encounters and guideline compliance
- Participated in dashboard design and interpretation of trends
- Co-authored final project documentation and presented findings

## Key Outcomes
- Delivered a functional end-to-end stroke tracking system
- Demonstrated integration of unfamiliar tools under time constraints
- Identified system limitations and proposed scalable future enhancements
- Strengthened collaboration, problem-solving, and technical communication skills

## Limitations & Future Work
- Scalability constraints of Microsoft Access for high-volume data
- Lack of direct EHR integration
- Opportunities for automation, audit logging, and web-based deployment

Future iterations could integrate EHR data feeds, migrate the interface to a web application, and support accreditation and regulatory reporting needs.
